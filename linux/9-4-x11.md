# x11 or `xorg`

first the style config:

with `nano ~/.Xdefaults` and add something like:
```
!!xterm
xterm*faceName: monospace
xterm*faceSize: 8
xterm*renderFont: true
xterm*VT100.translations: #override \n\
  Shift <Key>Insert: insert-selection(CLIPBOARD) \n\
  Ctrl  <Key>Insert: copy-selection(CLIPBOARD)

!!colors from https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1149930#p1149930
*background:    #101010
*foreground:    #66FF66
!black
*color0:        #1c1c1c
*color8:        #4d4d4d
!red
*color1:        #D81860
*color9:        #F00060
!green
*color2:        #60FF60
*color10:       #70FF70
!yellow
*color3:        #f9fd75
*color11:       #f9fd80
!blue
*color4:        #4695c8
*color12:       #5a9dc8
!magenta
*color5:        #a78edb
*color13:       #b29fdb
!cyan
*color6:        #43afce
*color14:       #69b8ce
!white
*color7:        #f3ebe2
*color15:       #eeeeee
```

then add a link: `ln -sfT ~/.Xdefaults ~/.Xresources`
  (maybe not needed, check: https://superuser.com/questions/243914/what-is-the-difference-between-xresources-and-xdefaults)


#### SSH X11 forwarding

For how to, check: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12755/how-to-forward-x-over-ssh-to-run-graphics-applications-remotely

The idea is display an X11 app remotely, through SSH connection,
  and it's quite usable in a LAN setup.

Compare to `crd` (Chrome Remote Desktop):
- good:
  - no public network required, just SSH is enough
  - use less resource on the server, since most window compose work is done client side
  - higher image quality, and better scrolling some times
  - no desktop-manager/window-manager required, so no need to install even `i3`, and the window is managed by the client window-manager
- bad:
  - not a daemon, so the SSH must be hold, or all window is gone, so no detach & resume experience
  - very high bandwidth, so maybe use at home only, reached ~100Mbps with 1080 display
  - not as responsive, since the quality do not drop even when it's time to drop frame, so not good for video
  - chromium will update the full viewport, so visible scan lines and not smooth at all, but other text editor do update just well

>   and ssh client with X11 forwarding option (like Putty/Xshell),
>   the setup is pretty simple.
> Just enable all X11 forwarding config, start local VcXsrv daemon,
>   SSH into the box and enter `xterm &`,
>   by default the X display at `localhost:0.0` will give you a window,
>   with X11 output inside, kind of opensource magic.


#### a somewhat usable Thinkpad X1 Tablet display config

The default render is too small, a usable reset is like: `xrandr --output eDP-1 --mode 3000x2000 --scale 0.5`

To enable external monitors, check: https://fedoramagazine.org/using-i3-with-multiple-monitors/
`xrandr --output HDMI-2 --auto --right-of eDP1`
